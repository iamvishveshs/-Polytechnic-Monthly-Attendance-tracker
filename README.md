3. **PDF Report Generation**:
   - The system generates a comprehensive attendance report in PDF format.
   - Reports include detailed attendance records and highlight students below the 75% threshold.

4. **User Interface**:
   - Simple and intuitive interface for data entry and report generation.
   - Options to filter and view attendance records by class, section, or individual students.

### Workflow

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Collect attendance data from class registers or electronic systems.
   - Input data into the system, specifying Theory and Practical classes.

2. **Processing**:
